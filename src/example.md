## The First Part **h2**

Hello! Welcome to the first part. **p**

### What we are doing **h3**

Making our react app use markdown files! **p**

### Why we are doing it **h3**

So that when we writing a LOT of text, we can write and style quickly using markdown instead of HTML! This allows us to write several markdown files with content that we need, and then use simple logic to determine which markdown file should be fed into our markdown component! **p**

### How we are doing it **h3**

Using the `markdown-to-jsx` component! **p** and **code**
